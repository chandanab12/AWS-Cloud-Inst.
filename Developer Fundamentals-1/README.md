# Python 

## History


Python is an interpreted, object-oriented programming language that is widely used in web applications, software development, data science, and machine learning (ML). 


- Guido Van Russom (1991) created Python.

- Some advantages include Readability, Productivity, Reusability, and Community. Interoperability, Portability

- Use Cases: Can be used for server-side web development, automation, data science and ML, S/W test automation

## IDE

- An IDE is an integrated development environment because it provides a central environment for common developer tools, making s/w development process more efficient.
  
- The default IDE for Python is IDLE(Integrated Development and Learning Environment).
  
-  Python operates in two modes: script and interactive. Script involves adding code into a script that Python can run. Interactive is a convenient way to run code and see the results in real-time.

- Example of interactive mode ![image](https://github.com/chandanab12/AWS-Cloud-Inst./assets/54497878/dd3878d6-d5a9-4a7f-a7a8-1f168faf6100)


-  IDE's help with compiling, testing, and debugging. System integration and collaboration. Syntax highlighting and correction.

## AWS Cloud9

AWS Cloud9 is a cloud-based IDE that supports several programming languages and runtime debuggers and has a built-in terminal. It can be accessed through a browser and configured based on your preferences. 

## Syntax 

Syntax refers to the rules that define the structure of a language. 

An indentation consists of the spaces at the beginning of a code line. 

## Variables 

A variable is a container for storing data values. 

Using variables makes your code flexible and reusable. 

Some rules to be followed while declaring a variable:

- They can have letters, digits, and underscores.

- They cannot have whitespace and symbols such as +, -, !, @,$,#,%

- They must start with a letter or the underscore character.

- They cannot start with a number

- They cannot be a Python keyword.

## Operators

Operators are used to operate on variables and values. 

- Arithmetic operators include addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), modulus (%), exponentiation (**), division (/), and floor division ( // ).

- Comparison operators include equal (==), not equal (!=), greater than (>), less than (<), greater than or equal to (>=), and less than or equal to (<=).

- Assignment operators are special symbols that combine the assignment operator (=) with another operator, such as addition (+) or subtraction (-).

- Logical operators include and, or, and not. Used to combine conditional statements.

- Bitwise operators include AND (&), OR (|), NOT (~), zero fill left shift (<<), signed right shift (>>), and Exclusive OR, also known as XOR (^). used when working with low- level programming languages.

- Membership operators include in and not in. used to test whether a value is a member of a sequence or collection.

- Identity operators include is and is not. used if values are of same data type and share the same memory location.

Operators Precedence in Python follows the PEMDAS rule 

P - Parentheses

E - Exponentiation

M - Multiplication and D - Division 

A- Addition and S - Subtraction 


## Data Types

Strings, Integer, Float, list, tuple, dict, set, frozenset, bool, bytes, bytearray, NoneType

- Use the + operator to concatenate strings

- f-strings are used to include variables in your strings.
  example- print(f'Hello, {name}. You are {age}.')
