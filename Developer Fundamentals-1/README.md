# Python 

## History


Python is an interpreted, object-oriented programming language that is widely used in web applications, software development, data science, and machine learning (ML). 


- Guido Van Russom (1991) created Python.

- Some advantages include Readability, Productivity, Reusability, and Community. Interoperability, Portability

- Use Cases: Can be used for server-side web development, automation, data science and ML, S/W test automation

## IDE

- An IDE is an integrated development environment because it provides a central environment for common developer tools, making s/w development process more efficient.
  
- The default IDE for Python is IDLE(Integrated Development and Learning Environment).
  
-  Python operates in two modes: script and interactive. Script involves adding code into a script that Python can run. Interactive is a convenient way to run code and see the results in real-time.

-  IDE's help with compiling, testing, and debugging. System integration and collaboration. Syntax highlighting and correction.
