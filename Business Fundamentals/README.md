- The 80/20 Rule in effective communication

  According to this - you spend 80% of the time gathering information and 20% on preparing the communication.

Four stages of effective communication
 - Understand the audience
 - Understand your core message
 - Choose the right mode of communication
 - Create effective visuals

Create an audience profile and focus solely on effective communication. 

For message planning:
- Define the objective
- Identify the audience's mindset
- Refine the message delivery (Type of communication, tone & style)

Clarity and coherence in your msg structure is important. 

## Change mindsets

A change mindset represents the willingness of your audience to accept your solution. 

- Full mindset - they are resistant to new solutions and are unlikely to change their minds. 
- Almost full - they find the current approach valuable, are resistant to change but find out more about their current situation and try changing their mind.
- Half mindset - The audience is comfortable with the current approach but is open to options. Have meaningful discussions and demonstrate value.
- Almost empty - The audience recognizes the need to change for development. Focus your discussions on problems and related opportunities with your solutions.
- Empty mindset - Audience do not see value in their current solution. When interacting with them highlight the benefits of your solution and help them do away with current issues.
