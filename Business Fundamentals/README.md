- The 80/20 Rule in effective communication

  According to this - you spend 80% of the time gathering information and 20% on preparing the communication.

Four stages of effective communication
 - Understand the audience
 - Understand your core message

## Change mindsets

A change mindset represents the willingness of your audience to accept your solution. 

- Full mindset - they are resistant to new solutions and are unlikely to change their minds. 
- Almost full - they find the current approach valuable, are resistant to change but find out more about their current situation and try changing their mind.
- Half mindset - The audience is comfortable with the current approach but is open to options. Have meaningful discussions and demonstrate value.
- Almost empty - The audience recognizes the need to change for development. Focus your discussions on problems and related opportunities with your solutions.
- Empty mindset - Audience do not see value in their current solution. When interacting with them highlight the benefits of your solution and help them do away with current issues. 

- Conduct thorough research into your audience's communication style. Make sure it resonates with them.
- Do not include idioms and explain any acronyms that you use.
- Slang consists of informal words and expressions. Clarity is essential.
- No offensive, double layered humour. There is a fine line between humour and sarcasm.
- Do not use double negatives. Be clear and concise.
- Avoid cognitive or information overload.

Things to keep in mind to avoid cognitive overload 
- Attention span - maintain it for the audience.
- Keep the audience attentive - with engaging content
- Working memory - split your info into parts of 3
- Forgetting curve - fight it by making your content personal, relatable, or interesting.

## Balance Sheet Close (Technique used to handle objections) Ben Franklin Close 
- Draw a large T shape on a piece of paper and list adv and disadv.


## Data Visualization 

Transforms large quantities of data into digestible info that people can mine for actionable insights. 

DV is data and information in a visual format such as charts, graphs, maps, and other graphical elements. 
Helps make complex data more accessible, understandable, and meaningful to people.

DV - Quantitative and Qualitative Visualizations 

### Quantitative (numeric)
Shows patterns and trends

### Qualitative (non-numeric)
Displays categories and frequencies

### Bar and column charts 
Good for visualizing categorical data. Differ in orientation. Bar - horizontal, Column - vertical

### Histograms 
A type of column chart that shows the distribution and frequency of data.

### Pie and Donut Charts 
Good for showing proportions. Use 2-5 slices and provide data labels.

### Regression Charts 
Important for predictive analysis. They add a trend line to a scatterplot. 
Two types of regression 
- Linear Regression - it has one independent variable
- Multiple linear regression - 2 or more independent variables

### Bubble charts 
Type of a scatterplot used when you want to visualise a thrid variable. Size of the bubble represents the third variable. 

![image](https://github.com/chandanab12/AWS-Cloud-Inst./assets/54497878/b17d21d8-0729-46b5-932d-85eea2c85599)

### Box and whisker plots 
If you need to view data in quartiles. They show a data set's  5 number summary: 
- Minimum observed data point
- Lower quartile
- Median
- Upper quartile
- Maximum observed data point
![image](https://github.com/chandanab12/AWS-Cloud-Inst./assets/54497878/44298a84-5d7f-4fa2-bcdc-e4deb56eda8f)

They can be vertical or horizontal and can summarize one or more related measurements. 

### Heatmaps 
Visualise variations in data by using color intensity.

### Geomaps and cartograms 
Used for displaying data on a map. 
Cartogram extend the concept of geomaps by displaying relative values in geographic space.

### Flomaps 
Display origin-destination data. Other forms of flow maps can add another variable by adjusting  the thickness of the flow lines, where a thicker line indicates more of something, such as physical goods flowing in a given direction.

### Alluvial Diagram 
A type of flow diagram that shows relationships and differences between groups across multiple variables. 

![image](https://github.com/chandanab12/AWS-Cloud-Inst./assets/54497878/b13fb3f4-a3d6-4ce5-8d2e-322c9c40d134)

### Sunburst charts 
They can display subgroups in a multilevel structure.

** Alluvial diagrams show flow while sunburst charts show hierarchy.

### Tree Maps 
Visually show hierarchical connections between data objects.
Tree maps are similar to sunbursts but use a block rather than a radial format.

### Dendrograms 
They cluster data. They do not reflect actual value but rather group items.

Clustering is often used with ML. 
- Word clouds are used to display the frequency of a word in the analyzed text. Particularly used in sentiment analysis or social media analysis.

Cooccurence models - useful for analysing how closely one word appears in relation to another.
